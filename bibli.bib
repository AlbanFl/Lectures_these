	abstract = {This paper extends earlier work by its authors on formal aspects of the processes of contracting a theory to eliminate a proposition and revising a theory to introduce a proposition. In the course of the earlier work, Gardenfors developed general postulates of a more or less equational nature for such processes, whilst Alchourron and Makinson studied the particular case of contraction functions that are maximal, in the sense of yielding a maximal subset of the theory (or alternatively, of one of its axiomatic bases), that fails to imply the proposition being eliminated. In the present paper, the authors study a broader class, including contraction functions that may be less than maximal. Specifically, they investigate "partial meet contraction functions", which are defined to yield the intersection of some nonempty family of maximal subsets of the theory that fail to imply the proposition being eliminated. Basic properties of these functions are established: it is shown in particular that they satisfy the Gardenfors postulates, and moreover that they are sufficiently general to provide a representation theorem for those postulates. Some special classes of partial meet contraction functions, notably those that are "relational" and "transitively relational", are studied in detail, and their connections with certain "supplementary postulates" of Gardenfors investigated, with a further representation theorem established.},

The success of intentional forgetting depends on how one originally encoded the to-be-forgotten information, the scope of the forget instruction, and the type of retrieval task done later. Memory-based processes of segregation and retrieval inhibition can lead to successful forgetting when Ss may forget all of the prior information. However, they are insufficient when Ss must forget only part of it. In this case, one "forgets" (i.e., limits expression of forget-cued information) by altering one's decision processes later. Successful intentional forgetting occurs only when one intentionally retrieves information from a particular learning episode, not when the task does not expressly require this (e.g., implicit memory tasks).

This not only hinders the realization of the original vision for the Semantic Web, but also creates a barrier to the development of new, powerful features for general knowledge applications that require proper treatment of uncertain phenomena. We present PR-OWL, a probabilistic extension to the OWL web ontology language that allows legacy ontologies to interoperate with newly developed probabilistic ontologies. PR-OWL moves beyond the current limitations of deterministic classical logic to a full first-order probabilistic logic. By providing a principled means of modeling uncertainty in ontologies, PR-OWL can be seen as a supporting tool for many applications that can benefit from probabilistic inference within an ontology language, thus representing an important step toward the W3C’s vision for the Semantic Web. In order to fully present the concepts behind PR-OWL, we also cover Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN), the Bayesian first-order logic supporting the language, and UnBBayes-MEBN, an open source GUI and reasoner that implements PR-OWL concepts. Finally, a use case of PR-OWL probabilistic ontologies is illustrated here in order to provide a grasp of the potential of the framework.},

	abstract = {A surprising finding from U.S. opinion surveys is that political disagreements tend to be greatest among the most cognitively sophisticated opposing partisans. Recent experiments suggest a hypothesis that could explain this pattern: cognitive sophistication magnifies politically biased processing of new information. However, the designs of these experiments tend to contain several limitations that complicate their support for this hypothesis. In particular, they tend to (i) focus on people's worldviews and political identities, at the expense of their other, more specific prior beliefs, (ii) lack direct comparison with a politically unbiased benchmark, and (iii) focus on people's judgments of new information, rather than on their posterior beliefs following exposure to the information. We report two studies designed to address these limitations. In our design, U.S. subjects received noisy but informative signals about the truth or falsity of partisan political questions, and we measured their prior and posterior beliefs, and cognitive sophistication, operationalized as analytic thinking inferred via performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test. We compared subjects' posterior beliefs to an unbiased Bayesian benchmark. We found little evidence that analytic thinking magnified politically biased deviations from the benchmark. In contrast, we found consistent evidence that greater analytic thinking was associated with posterior beliefs closer to the benchmark. Together, these results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that cognitive sophistication magnifies politically biased processing. We discuss differences between our design and prior work that can inform future tests of this hypothesis.},

A series of experiments involving a program which learns to traverse state spaces is described. It is shown that most of the knowledge acquired is of negative value even though it is correct and was acquired solving similar problems. It is shown that the value of the knowledge depends on what else is known and that random forgetting can sometimes lead to substantial improvements in performance. It is concluded that research into knowledge acquisition should take seriously the possibility that knowledge may sometimes be harmful.

	abstract = {Forgetting is an ambivalent concept of (human) intelligence. By definition, it is negatively related to knowledge in that knowledge is lost, be it deliberately or not, and therefore, forgetting has not received as much attention in the field of knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) as other processes with a more positive orientation, like query answering, inference, or update. However, from a cognitive view, forgetting also has an ordering function in the human mind, suppressing information that is deemed irrelevant and improving cognitive capabilities to focus and deal only with relevant aspects of the problem under consideration. In this regard, forgetting is a crucial part of reasoning. This paper collects and surveys approaches to forgetting in the field of knowledge representation and reasoning, highlighting their roles in diverse tasks of knowledge processing, and elaborating on common techniques. We recall forgetting operations for propositional and predicate logic, as well as for answer set programming (as an important representative of nonmonotonic logics) and modal logics. We discuss forgetting in the context of (ir)relevance and (in)dependence, and explicit the role of forgetting for specific tasks of knowledge representation, showing its positive impact on solving KRR problems.},

In artificial intelligence (AI) systems, capacity of knowledge bases is limited due to computational complexity of many inference algorithms. Consequently, continuously sampling information and unfiltered storing in knowledge bases does not seem to be a promising or even feasible strategy. In human evolution, learning and forgetting have evolved as advantageous strategies for coping with available information by adding new knowledge to and removing irrelevant information from the human memory. Learning has been adopted in AI systems in various algorithms and applications. Forgetting, however, especially intentional forgetting, has not been sufficiently considered, yet. Thus, the objective of this paper is to discuss intentional forgetting in the context of AI systems as a first step. Starting with the new priority research program on ‘Intentional Forgetting’ (DFG-SPP 1921), definitions and interpretations of intentional forgetting in AI systems from different perspectives (knowledge representation, cognition, ontologies, reasoning, machine learning, self-organization, and distributed AI) are presented and opportunities as well as challenges are derived.},

We suggest that, in a statistical account of conditioning, surprise signals change and therefore uncertainty and the need for new learning.

	abstract = {Networks of ontologies are made of a collection of logic theories, called ontologies, related by alignments. They arise naturally in distributed contexts in which theories are developed and maintained independently, such as the semantic web. In networks of ontologies, inconsistency can come from two different sources: local inconsistency in a particular ontology or alignment, and global inconsistency between them. Belief revision is well-defined for dealing with ontologies; we investigate how it can apply to networks of ontologies. We formulate revision postulates for alignments and networks of ontologies based on an abstraction of existing semantics of networks of ontologies. We show that revision operators cannot be simply based on local revision operators on both ontologies and alignments. We adapt the partial meet revision framework to networks of ontologies and show that it indeed satisfies the revision postulates. Finally, we consider strategies based on network characteristics for designing concrete revision operators.},

	abstract = {In times of Big Data and Industry 4.0, organizational information as well as knowledge availability and quantity are driving complex decision-making tasks. Especially for AI systems, increasing knowledge-bases for elaborate computations lead to a lower efficiency of their inference mechanisms. In contrast to AI, bounded cognitive capacity is a well-known problem in psychology. When humans receive too much information, a state of information overload emerges. In order to cope with limited capacity and prevent information overload, humans adapt their knowledge and delete, override, suppress, or sort out outdated information, i.e., they forget. By transferring theories from human cognition to multiagent systems, the AdaptPRO project adopts intentional forgetting as a strategy for coping with information overload in both human and multiagent teams. This article gives an overview of an interdisciplinary research project with a strong focus on knowledge distributions and knowledge dynamics from a distributed AI perspective. Its core contribution is a formal model for distributing and adapting (meta-) knowledge by intentional forgetting to enable efficient and resilient teamwork.},
