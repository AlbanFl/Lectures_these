	abstract = {This paper extends earlier work by its authors on formal aspects of the processes of contracting a theory to eliminate a proposition and revising a theory to introduce a proposition. In the course of the earlier work, Gardenfors developed general postulates of a more or less equational nature for such processes, whilst Alchourron and Makinson studied the particular case of contraction functions that are maximal, in the sense of yielding a maximal subset of the theory (or alternatively, of one of its axiomatic bases), that fails to imply the proposition being eliminated. In the present paper, the authors study a broader class, including contraction functions that may be less than maximal. Specifically, they investigate "partial meet contraction functions", which are defined to yield the intersection of some nonempty family of maximal subsets of the theory that fail to imply the proposition being eliminated. Basic properties of these functions are established: it is shown in particular that they satisfy the Gardenfors postulates, and moreover that they are sufficiently general to provide a representation theorem for those postulates. Some special classes of partial meet contraction functions, notably those that are "relational" and "transitively relational", are studied in detail, and their connections with certain "supplementary postulates" of Gardenfors investigated, with a further representation theorem established.},

	abstract = {Some knowledge based systems will have to deal with increasing amount of knowledge. In order to avoid memory overflow, it is necessary to clean memory of useless data. Here is a first step toward an intelligent automatic forgetting scheme. The problem of the close relation between forgetting and inferring is addressed, and a general solution is proposed. It is implemented as invalidation operators for reasoning maintenance system dependency graphs. This results in a general architecture for selective forgetting which is presented in the framework of the Sachem system.},

	isbn = {978-0-521-54564-8},
	abstract = {Belief revision is a topic of much interest in theoretical computer science and logic, and it forms a central problem in research into artificial intelligence. In simple terms: how do you update a database of knowledge in the light of new information? What if the new information is in conflict with something that was previously held to be true? An intelligent system should be able to accommodate all such cases. This book contains a collection of research articles on belief revision that are completely up to date and an introductory chapter that presents a survey of current research in the area and the fundamentals of the theory. Thus this volume will be useful as a textbook on belief revision.},

	abstract = {Current trends, like digital transformation and ubiquitous computing, yield in massive increase in available data and information. In artificial intelligence (AI) systems, capacity of knowledge bases is limited due to computational complexity of many inference algorithms. Consequently, continuously sampling information and unfiltered storing in knowledge bases does not seem to be a promising or even feasible strategy. In human evolution, learning and forgetting have evolved as advantageous strategies for coping with available information by adding new knowledge to and removing irrelevant information from the human memory. Learning has been adopted in AI systems in various algorithms and applications. Forgetting, however, especially intentional forgetting, has not been sufficiently considered, yet. Thus, the objective of this paper is to discuss intentional forgetting in the context of AI systems as a first step. Starting with the new priority research program on ‘Intentional Forgetting’ (DFG-SPP 1921), definitions and interpretations of intentional forgetting in AI systems from different perspectives (knowledge representation, cognition, ontologies, reasoning, machine learning, self-organization, and distributed AI) are presented and opportunities as well as challenges are derived.},

Especially for the development of socio-digital systems utilizing artificial intelligence (AI), the question arises how to deal with growing amounts of information.

This article presents a short terminological overview and systematic of psychological concepts of forgetting from an individual, group, and organizational level. These views at the micro-, meso-, and macro-level may stimulate interdisciplinary research and offer models of intentional forgetting for single and multi-agent AI systems.},
